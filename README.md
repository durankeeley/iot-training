### Terminology and Technologies

**Containers:** software that packages applications, codes, dependencies and configurations, so the application runs quickly and reliably across computing environments. Containers are much more lightweight and use far fewer resources than virtual machines.

**Docker:** A platform that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

**Message Queue:** is a form of *service*-to-*service* communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Service subscribers access queues and or topics to exchange data using point-to-point or publish and subscribe patterns.

**MQTT:** The Standard for IoT Messaging, a lightweight, publish-subscribe, machine to machine network protocol for Message queue/Message queuing service. It is designed for connections with remote locations that have devices with resource constraints or limited network bandwidth.
