## Overview

### Terminology and Technologies

**Containers:** These are small, lightweight pieces of software that contain all the necessary code, dependencies, and configurations for an application to run. They allow an application to be easily run on any computer or server, without the need to install or configure anything.

**Docker:** This is a platform that allows you to create and run containers. It provides tools and infrastructure to make it easy to build, ship, and run containers in a variety of environments.

**The Internet of Things (IoT):** This refers to the connection of devices (other than traditional computers and smartphones) to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data. These devices can include everyday objects like thermostats, lights, appliances, and even vehicles. Overall, the goal of IoT is to make our lives easier and more convenient by allowing us to control and monitor devices remotely and automatically.

**Digital Twin:** This is a digital version of a real-world product, system, or process. It can be used to simulate and analyze the behavior of the real-world entity, or to control and monitor it remotely.

**Low-code/no-code:** These are software development tools that allow you to build applications without needing to write code. You can use visual interfaces to drag and drop pre-built components and connect them together to create mobile or web apps.

**Message Queue:** This is a way for different software services to communicate with each other by sending messages. Services can send messages to a queue, and other services can retrieve them and process them. This allows services to operate independently and asynchronously, without the need to directly connect to each other.

**MQTT:** This is a lightweight, publish-subscribe networking protocol that is designed for use in constrained environments, such as those found in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It allows devices to communicate with each other and send messages using a message queue.

**MVC:** This is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The model represents the data and business logic of the application, the view represents the user interface, and the controller mediates the interaction between the model and the view. This allows different parts of the application to be developed and maintained independently, and makes it easier to change and extend the application over time.

## Setting up the environment

Everything in this training has been built using `docker-compose` and to spin up the environment use the following command `docker-compose up -d`
